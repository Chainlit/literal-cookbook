# Financial Dashboard with AI Copilot

This project is a financial dashboard enhanced with an AI copilot, featuring Generative UI and an interactive experience.

## Key Features

- **AI Copilot**: An intelligent assistant that helps users navigate the dashboard, understand financial data, and make informed decisions.
- **Generative UI**: Dynamic user interface elements that adapt to user needs and data patterns, providing a personalized experience.
- **Interactive Experience**: Engaging visualizations and real-time data updates that allow users to explore financial information intuitively.

The AI copilot leverages natural language processing to understand user queries and provide context-aware responses. The Generative UI dynamically creates and adjusts dashboard components based on user behavior and data relevance. Together, these features create a powerful, interactive financial tool that caters to both novice and expert users.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
