# Build a chatbot using NextJS, OpenAI and Literal AI

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

From Literal AI, create a prompt of your choice named "Simple Chatbot".
The Next.js application relies on this prompt to format the user messages.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your project is now accessible at http://localhost:3000
